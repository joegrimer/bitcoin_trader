Bitcoin trader (originally ecoSim.py)

This is an economy simulator I wrote on 18/11/2016 (mostly). I'm quite happy with it, I must admit!

Ideas for further improvement:
- Before the game starts, detirmine which factors will affect the economy. The news will talk about what's happening. Most of it will be irrelevant. However, some of the factors will have direct affect (plus or minus a chaos factor) on the price of whatever is being bought.
- Remove all post-initialisation randomness to make the game more realistic
